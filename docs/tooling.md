# Repository Tooling

`lint:rust` owns Clippy with warnings denied. `check:rust` includes it, and CI
Check / Rust gates it. Build, test, bench, fixture and focused compilation tasks
retain compiler preflight without running Clippy. Use an explicit
`mise run build:rust:focused -- clippy <arguments>` for a selected Clippy run.

Benchmark targets and their matching fixtures are covered by `lint:rust`.

`mise run lint:rust --extended` lints the optional compatibility selections;
`build:rust:compatibility` checks them without Clippy. Extended lint remains local-only.

Mise is the public entry point. The project-owned Python task wrappers live in
`tools/python/src/harmos_tools/`; the root uv workspace owns `.venv/` and
`uv.lock`. Run `mise run prepare:tools` to synchronize the locked tools.

## Workstation Builds

Compiling tasks run through `tools/python/src/harmos_tools/build/machine.py`, which starts the
shared compiler cache for the command. Nothing serializes compilation: tasks in
any repository or worktree run at the same time, and no worker or compiler
thread limits are added.

For non-CI runs, `mise.toml` selects `RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache`,
`SCCACHE_DIR=<OS user cache>/sccache`, `SCCACHE_CACHE_SIZE=20G` and disables
incremental compilation. Each worktree keeps its own `target/`; matching
cacheable crate compilations can reuse results across worktrees. CI retains
its existing per-profile cache settings. sccache is already a pinned mise tool.
Local wrappers reuse the existing `ci/compiler.py` foreground-server helper with
an owned endpoint, so an older daemon cannot silently select another store.
Concurrent tasks each own a server on the same store. Only that owned server is
stopped after the command; each task prints its cache hit and miss counts.
If allocation failures recur, disable it for one run by setting
`RUSTC_WRAPPER` to an empty value:

```sh
RUSTC_WRAPPER= mise run build
```

In PowerShell use `$env:RUSTC_WRAPPER = ''; mise run build`, then remove
the override with `Remove-Item Env:RUSTC_WRAPPER`.

## Focused Integration Tests

The integration task accepts a nextest filter and repeat count while retaining
the configured per-test hang guards from `[conventions.testing.deadlines]` in
`tools/project.toml`. Completed story durations remain measurements. It consumes the existing test archive and fixtures:

```sh
mise run test:rust:integration --filter 'package(=harmos-runtime) & test(=sidecar::observer_demand::demand_survives_reload)' --stress-count 50
```

Select `--profile release` to use an archive and fixtures from a Nightly build.

## Validation

Run targeted tasks locally. Hosted CI and Nightly provide full validation.
