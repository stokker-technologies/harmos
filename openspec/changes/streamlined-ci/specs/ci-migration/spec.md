# CI Migration

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Adopt The Agreed Hub Contract
The product SHALL migrate its authored tasks and configuration and canonically generated tooling/workflows to the locked Hub CI contracts while preserving required native platform coverage, artifact dependencies and release behavior.

#### Scenario: Candidate Delivery
- **WHEN** complete source passes applicable local proof
- **THEN** publish the candidate PR to dev, monitor and repair required provider checks until green, merge with protections enforced and verify the merged revision.

### Requirement: Honest Baseline And Repairs
The initial full baseline SHALL run before implementation as explicitly requested; every observed existing failure remains actionable and cannot waive final gates. Only targeted proof runs during migration until source closes. Optional nightly workloads are excluded unless explicitly requested.

#### Scenario: Baseline Failure
- **WHEN** an initial lane fails or a prerequisite prevents it running
- **THEN** record the actual result, repair the cause within the authorized migration and prove required behavior before delivery.
